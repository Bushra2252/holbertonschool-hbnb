## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview
The HBnB (Holberton Airbnb) project is a comprehensive web application that replicates the core functionality of Airbnb. This technical document serves as a detailed blueprint for the HBnB project, providing architectural guidance and design specifications for the implementation phases.

### Document Purpose
This document consolidates all architectural diagrams, design decisions, and system specifications created during the planning phase. It serves as:
- A reference guide for development teams
- A blueprint for system implementation
- Documentation of design decisions and their rationale
- A communication tool for stakeholders

### Document Scope
This documentation covers:
- High-level system architecture using package diagrams
- Detailed business logic layer class relationships
- API interaction flows through sequence diagrams
- Design patterns and architectural decisions

## 2. High-Level Architecture

### Package Diagram Overview
*Created by: Bushra Alotaibi*

![Package Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/GO6aUJy.png)

The HBnB application follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns across three main layers:
2.1 ðŸ”¹ Presentation Layer

Responsibility: Handles user interactions through services and APIs
Components: Web interfaces, mobile apps, RESTful API endpoints
Function: Manages all user-facing interactions and external service communications
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React/Vue.js, API Gateway

2.2 ðŸ”¹ Business Logic Layer

Responsibility: Contains core application logic and models
Core Models: User, Place, Review, and Amenity
Design Pattern: Accessed through a simplified interface using the Facade pattern
Function: Implements business rules, validation, and core application workflows
Benefits: Simplified interface hides complex subsystem interactions

2.3 ðŸ”¹ Persistence Layer

Responsibility: Responsible for data access via DAOs and direct interaction with the database
Components: Data Access Objects (DAOs), Database connections, ORM frameworks
Function: Handles all data storage, retrieval, and database operations
Technologies: SQL databases, ORM frameworks, connection pooling

Architecture Benefits

Modularity: Clear separation enables independent development and testing
Scalability: Each layer can be scaled independently based on system demands
Maintainability: Isolated concerns reduce complexity and improve code organization
Testability: Each layer can be tested in isolation with proper mocking
Facade Pattern Implementation: Provides a unified interface to the complex business logic subsystem

## 3. Business Logic Layer

### Class Diagram Structure

The business logic layer implements the core entities and their relationships within the HBnB system as illustrated in the UML class diagram above.


## 4. API Interaction Flow 

### Sequence Diagrams Overview
*Created by: Raghad Albeladi*

The sequence diagrams illustrate the interaction flow between different components for key API operations. These diagrams show how the Presentation Layer (UI/API), Business Logic Layer (Services), and Persistence Layer (Database) communicate to handle user requests.

## 4.1 **Sign Up / Login
This diagram shows the authentication process when a user attempts to log into the system.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant UI as UI
    participant API as Controller/API
    participant Auth as Auth Service
    participant DB as Database

    U->>UI: Enter credentials
    UI->>API: POST /auth/login
    API->>Auth: IsUserAuthorized(userID, password)
    Auth->>DB: Validate credentials
    DB-->>Auth: User data
    Auth-->>API: true/false
    
    alt [if true]
        API->>DB: Generate session/token
        DB-->>API: Success
        API-->>UI: 200 OK + token
        UI-->>U: Login Successful
    else [else]
        API-->>UI: 401 Unauthorized
        UI-->>U: Error Message
    end
```
Key Interactions:

User submits credentials through the UI
API validates credentials through Auth Service
Database verification and token generation
Success or error response to user 

## 4.2  **Get Room Details Flow**
This diagram illustrates how the system retrieves and displays detailed information about a specific place/room.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as USER
    participant UI as UI
    participant API as Backend/API
    participant DB as Database/Service

    U->>UI: click view room details
    UI->>API: GET /api/rooms/{roomId}
    API->>DB: GetRoomDetails(ID)
    DB-->>API: Return Room details model
    API-->>UI: Room details (JSON)
    UI-->>U: Render room details page
```
Key Interactions:

User requests to view room details
API fetches room information from database
Structured room data returned as JSON
UI renders the detailed room information

## 4.3 **Add Review Flow**
This diagram shows the process of adding a review for a place, including authentication and authorization checks.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant UI as UI
    participant API as Controller/API
    participant Auth as Auth Service
    participant Service as Model/Services
    participant DB as DB

    U->>UI: Click Add Review button
    UI->>API: call post:/api/rooms/{id}/review
    
    alt [authentication check]
        API->>Auth: IsUserAuthorized(userID,roomID)
        Auth-->>API: true/false
        
        alt [if true]
            API->>Service: AddValidateDataReview(data)
            Service->>DB: AddReview(Data)
            DB-->>Service: Success
            Service-->>API: success
            API-->>UI: 201 Create
            UI-->>U: Created Successfully
        else [else]
            API-->>UI: 403 Forbidden
            UI-->>U: Error Message
        end
    end
```
Key Interactions:

User initiates review creation
System verifies user authorization
Review data validation through Service layer
Database persistence with success confirmation

## 4.4 **Delete Place**
This diagram demonstrates the place deletion process with proper authorization checks.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant UI as UI
    participant API as Backend/API
    participant Auth as Auth Service
    participant DB as DB/Services

    U->>UI: Click delete button
    UI->>API: call post:/api/room/{id}/delete
    
    alt [authorization check]
        API->>Auth: IsUserAuthorized(userID,roomID)
        Auth-->>API: true/false
        
        alt [if true]
            API->>DB: deleteRoom(roomId)
            DB-->>API: success
            API-->>UI: 204 ok
            UI-->>U: Deleted Successfully
        else [else]
            API-->>UI: 403 Forbidden
            UI-->>U: Error Message
        end
    end
```
Key Interactions:

User requests place deletion
Authorization verification for ownership
Database deletion operation
Success confirmation or error handling
