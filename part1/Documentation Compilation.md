## 2. High-Level Architecture

### Package Diagram Overview
*Created by: Bushra Alotaibi*

![Package Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/GO6aUJy.png)

The HBnB application follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns across three main layers:
2.1 ðŸ”¹ Presentation Layer

Responsibility: Handles user interactions through services and APIs
Components: Web interfaces, mobile apps, RESTful API endpoints
Function: Manages all user-facing interactions and external service communications
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React/Vue.js, API Gateway

2.2 ðŸ”¹ Business Logic Layer

Responsibility: Contains core application logic and models
Core Models: User, Place, Review, and Amenity
Design Pattern: Accessed through a simplified interface using the Facade pattern
Function: Implements business rules, validation, and core application workflows
Benefits: Simplified interface hides complex subsystem interactions

2.3 ðŸ”¹ Persistence Layer

Responsibility: Responsible for data access via DAOs and direct interaction with the database
Components: Data Access Objects (DAOs), Database connections, ORM frameworks
Function: Handles all data storage, retrieval, and database operations
Technologies: SQL databases, ORM frameworks, connection pooling

Architecture Benefits

Modularity: Clear separation enables independent development and testing
Scalability: Each layer can be scaled independently based on system demands
Maintainability: Isolated concerns reduce complexity and improve code organization
Testability: Each layer can be tested in isolation with proper mocking
Facade Pattern Implementation: Provides a unified interface to the complex business logic subsystem

## 3. Business Logic Layer

### Class Diagram Structure
*Created by: Najwa Aljunaidel*

![Class digram](./Class%20Diagram.drawio.svg)

3.2 Entity Relationships
Based on the class diagram, the relationships are:

User â†” Place:

Relationship: One-to-Many (1 user can own multiple places)
Implementation: User has listPlaces() method


User â†” Review:

Relationship: One-to-Many (1 user can write multiple reviews)
Implementation: User has listReviews() method


Place â†” Review:

Relationship: One-to-Many (1 place can have multiple reviews)
Implementation: Review references Place entity


Place â†” Amenity:

Relationship: Many-to-Many (Places can have multiple amenities, amenities can belong to multiple places)
Implementation: Both entities have list methods for cross-referencing



3.3 Business Rules Implementation

Authentication Required: User entity validates permissions for place and review operations
Ownership Validation: Place entity ensures only owners can modify place information
Review Restrictions: Review entity prevents users from reviewing their own places
Data Integrity: All entities use UUID for unique identification
Audit Trail: All entities maintain creation and update timestamps

4. API Interaction Flow
Sequence Diagrams Overview
Created by: Raghad Albeladi
The sequence diagrams illustrate the interaction flow between different components for key API operations. These diagrams show how the Presentation Layer (UI/API), Business Logic Layer (Services), and Persistence Layer (Database) communicate to handle user requests.
4.1 ðŸ”¹ Sign Up / Login Flow
This diagram shows the authentication process when a user attempts to log into the system.
```
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant UI as UI
    participant API as Controller/API
    participant Auth as Auth Service
    participant DB as Database
    U->>UI: Enter credentials
    UI->>API: POST /auth/login
    API->>Auth: IsUserAuthorized(userID, password)
    Auth->>DB: Validate credentials
    DB-->>Auth: User data
    Auth-->>API: true/false
    
    alt [if true]
        API->>DB: Generate session/token
        DB-->>API: Success
        API-->>UI: 200 OK + token
        UI-->>U: Login Successful
    else [else]
        API-->>UI: 401 Unauthorized
        UI-->>U: Error Message
    end
   ```
Key Interactions:

User submits credentials through the UI
API validates credentials through Auth Service
Database verification and token generation
Success or error response to user

4.2 ðŸ”¹ Get Room Details Flow

  ```sequenceDiagram
    participant U as USER
    participant UI as UI
    participant API as Backend/API
    participant DB as Database/Service
    U->>UI: click view room details
    UI->>API: GET /api/rooms/{roomId}
    API->>DB: GetRoomDetails(ID)
    DB-->>API: Return Room details model
    API-->>UI: Room details (JSON)
    UI-->>U: Render room details page
```
Key Interactions:

User requests to view room details
API fetches room information from database
Structured room data returned as JSON
UI renders the detailed room information

4.3 ðŸ”¹ Add Review Flow

    alt [authentication check]
        API->>Auth: IsUserAuthorized(userID,roomID)
        Auth-->>API: true/false
        
        alt [if true]
            API->>Service: AddValidateDataReview(data)
            Service->>DB: AddReview(Data)
            DB-->>Service: Success
            Service-->>API: success
            API-->>UI: 201 Create
            UI-->>U: Created Successfully
        else [else]
            API-->>UI: 403 Forbidden
            UI-->>U: Error Message
        end
    end
```
Key Interactions:

System verifies user authorization
Review data validation through Service layer
Database persistence with success confirmation

4.4 ðŸ”¹ Delete Place Flow
This diagram demonstrates the place deletion process with proper authorization checks.

```
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant UI as UI
    participant API as Backend/API
    participant Auth as Auth Service
    participant DB as DB/Services
    U->>UI: Click delete button
    UI->>API: call post:/api/room/{id}/delete
    
    alt [authorization check]
        API->>Auth: IsUserAuthorized(userID,roomID)
        Auth-->>API: true/false
        
        alt [if true]
            API->>DB: deleteRoom(roomId)
            DB-->>API: success
            API-->>UI: 204 ok
            UI-->>U: Deleted Successfully
        else [else]
            API-->>UI: 403 Forbidden
            UI-->>U: Error Message
        end
    end
```

Key Interactions:

User requests place deletion
Authorization verification for ownership
Database deletion operation
Success confirmation or error handling

API Design Principles
Based on the sequence diagrams, the system follows these key principles:

RESTful Architecture: Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST) and appropriate status codes
Authentication & Authorization: Comprehensive security checks for protected operations
Layered Communication: Clear separation between UI, API, Services, and Database layers
Error Handling: Proper error responses (401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 204 OK)
Data Validation: Service layer validates data before database operations
Consistent Response Format: Uniform JSON structure and HTTP status codes
